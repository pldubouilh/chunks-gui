Chrome extra
==========

Very WIP. I'd love to see a chrome extension (app ?) for that, but [ed25519-supercop](https://github.com/substack/ed25519-supercop) doesn't seems to play nice with browserify as the module is only providing C++ bindings.

Although, [Google does seem to provide assitance with native code](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/tutorial/tutorial-part1). Porting the supercop dark magic should also be possible using JS...
